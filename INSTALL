		OpenAtom Massively Parallel Code v1.0
=======================================================================

INSTALLATION

1. To compile OpenAtom, you need to specify the following things:
    i.   Charm++ Installation Path
    ii.  FFTW Library Path
    iii. Optimized Math Libraries

2. Before anything else, copy the machine specific configuration file 
   (config.MACHINE.mk) in the makefiles/ directory to the OpenAtom base 
   directory and rename it to config.mk.

   Linux Workstations config.mk
   Abe (NCSA)         config.abe.mk
   Blue Gene/L        config.bgl.mk
   Ranger (TACC)      config.ranger.mk
   Surveyor (ANL)     config.surveyor.mk
   Turing             config.turing.mk
   XT3/XT4            config.xt3.mk
  
2. To install Charm++, download a copy from http://charm.cs.illinois.edu
   Depending on the architecture of the machine, choose the right
   build options and build Charm.
   If you have trouble building Charm, mail ppl AT cs.uiuc.edu

   Edit the CHARMBASE variable in config.mk to point to the
   Charm++ installation.

3. OpenAtom requires double precision FFTW installed in some location.
   
   Edit the FFT_HOME variable in config.mk to point to the
   FFTW installation. You might also need to edit the DUAL_FFTW 
   variable depending on how FFTW was compiled. It takes two values:
   DUAL_FFTW_OFF and DUAL_FFTW

4. Check to make sure the optimization options are the ones that you
   desire. These are set as the value of the variable OPT in the 
   config.mk file. These flags are also suffixed to the name of the
   build directory giving you a separate directory for each different
   set of flags.

5. Be sure to type 'make help' to review the different options you have
   when invoking the build. For e.g., parallel builds can be much faster
   if your machine supports it.

6. To start the build, simply type make in the top-level directory along
   with any other options that you require.  The binary 'OpenAtom' is 
   placed in the build directory whose name is indicated at the start 
   and end of the build process.
